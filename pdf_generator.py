          investors but require formal pitch decks and more established startups.

          on product pre-sales rather than equity investment.
        
        • Content Platforms: Medium and Hashnode demonstrate the value of content-focused communities 
          but lack integrated investment capabilities.
        
        • Research on Early-Stage Funding: Studies indicate that access to early capital is a significant 
          predictor of startup success, yet remains one of the biggest challenges for new entrepreneurs.
        
        • Technology Adoption in Investment: Recent trends show increased adoption of digital platforms 
          for investment processes, accelerated by global shifts toward remote business operations.
